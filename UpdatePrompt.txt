Dynamic Quiz & Evaluation Module (Course-Based, Anytime Quiz)
🔹 ROLE
You are a Senior Full-Stack Engineer and System Architect.
Design and implement a Dynamic, Course-Based Quiz & Evaluation Module for an online teaching platform.
The quiz questions must be selected dynamically at quiz start time, persisted per student attempt, and evaluated with performance insights and improvement suggestions.
🔹 SCOPE (STRICT)
✅ Course-based quizzes
✅ Quiz can be started anytime
✅ Quiz created by Tutor & Admin
✅ Dynamic question selection at quiz start
❌ No scheduled quizzes
❌ No live quizzes
❌ No assignments
🔹 STUDENT QUIZ FLOW
Student selects Course
Student selects Difficulty Level
Student starts quiz
System dynamically selects questions using an algorithm
Selected questions are stored as a Quiz Session for the student
Timer starts immediately
Answers auto-saved
Auto-submit on timeout or manual submit
Evaluation & improvement suggestions shown
🔹 QUIZ CHARACTERISTICS
Each quiz must have:
courseId
difficultyLevel (Easy | Medium | Hard)
createdBy (Tutor/Admin)
duration (minutes)
totalMarks
passingPercentage
attemptsAllowed
Draft → Published → Archived
Shuffle questions/options
Optional negative marking
Question selection rules (not static list)
🔹 DYNAMIC QUESTION SELECTION (CRITICAL)
QUESTION SELECTION RULES
Questions pulled from Question Bank
Filtered by:
courseId
difficultyLevel
Algorithm must support:
Random selection

Avoid repetition from past attempts
Difficulty balancing
Algorithm must be pluggable & replaceable later
⚠️ Quiz does NOT store static question list
⚠️ QuizAttempt / QuizSession stores selected questions
🔹 QUESTION TYPES SUPPORTED
MCQ (single/multiple)
True / False
Numerical (with tolerance)
Short Answer
Long Answer (Subjective)
Case-based
🔹 BACKEND – REQUIRED API CONTRACTS
QUIZ MANAGEMENT (Tutor/Admin)
POST /api/quizzes

    }
  },
  "settings": {
    "shuffleQuestions": true,
    "negativeMarking": true
  }
}
